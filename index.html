    <title>The Unquiet Ghost: An Interactive Report on Romanticism</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Terra & Sky -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a non-linear, thematic exploration rather than a simple scrollable report. The structure centers on the core thesis: the duality of Romanticism's legacy and its ongoing conflict with Enlightenment ideals. The architecture has four main sections, accessible via a sticky navigation: 1) 'The Core Conflict' introduces the thesis. 2) 'The Romantic DNA' allows users to interactively explore the five core tenets and their dual enlightened/authoritarian manifestations, replacing the static table from the report. 3) 'The Inheritance' uses a simplified, clickable timeline to trace the evolution from ideas to political movements like fascism and populism. 4) 'The Modern Battlefield' presents the contemporary case studies (populism, public health, environment) using interactive charts and diagrams to make the abstract arguments tangible. This structure was chosen because the report's power lies in its connections and paradoxes, which a user can better understand by navigating between themes, comparing ideas, and interacting with the data, rather than reading linearly. The goal is synthesis and discovery, not just presentation. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Core Tenets Diagram: Report Info -> Table of dual tenets. Goal -> Show the central paradox. Viz -> Interactive HTML/CSS diagram where clicking a tenet (e.g., 'Individual') reveals two cards for its 'Liberal' and 'Authoritarian' sides. Justification -> More engaging and memorable than a static table. 2) Ideological Divergence Chart: Report Info -> Analysis of liberalism vs. nationalism/fascism. Goal -> Compare ideologies based on Romantic traits. Viz -> Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js) comparing ideologies on axes like 'Emotional Appeal' or 'Mythic Past'. Justification -> Quantifies and clarifies the qualitative analysis of divergent political paths. 3) Populist Rhetoric Chart: Report Info -> Analysis of Trump's rally speeches. Goal -> Deconstruct populist spectacle. Viz -> Stacked Bar Chart (Chart.js) breaking down rhetoric into components ('Crisis Narrative', 'Blame', 'Solution'). Justification -> Makes the abstract concept of political spectacle easy to analyze. 4) Epistemological Gulf Diagram: Report Info -> Conflict between scientific empiricism and romantic subjectivity. Goal -> Clarify the two opposing paths to "truth". Viz -> Two-column HTML/CSS diagram. Justification -> Simplifies a complex philosophical conflict into a clear visual comparison, central to the anti-science thesis. All interactions are handled with vanilla JS. -->

                        This application explores the argument that Romanticism never ended. Its core values—the primacy of emotion, subjective experience, and the heroic individual—have become a hidden operating system for modern life. This has created a two-century-long war between the Romantic worldview and the Enlightenment's legacy of rationalism. Where the Enlightenment seeks truth through objective facts, Romanticism finds it in intuition and personal belief. This interactive report unpacks that conflict, showing how it shapes everything from our politics to our perception of reality itself.

                        At its heart, Romanticism is defined by a few core tenets. But each of these principles contains a paradox, giving rise to both enlightened, liberal ideals and their authoritarian, negative counterparts. Click on a tenet below to see its dual legacy. This interactive diagram replaces the static table in the original report to better illustrate the core tensions.

                        Romantic ideas didn't stay in books and paintings. They evolved and were weaponized, shaping the political landscape of the modern world. This section visualizes the journey from philosophical concept to political reality, tracing a direct line from Romantic nationalism to the authoritarian spectacles of the 20th and 21st centuries. The chart below shows how different ideologies inherited and twisted Romantic traits.

                Romanticism is not dead; it is a volatile and paradoxical inheritance. It is the source of our most cherished ideals of individual freedom and our most dangerous political pathologies of mob irrationalism. The challenge of the 21st century is to navigate this double-edged legacy: to harness the empathetic power of the Romantic spirit while defending against its seductive, and potentially fatal, war on reason.
